VictoriaLogs is an [open source](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/app/victoria-logs), extremely fast, and cost-effective database for logs from [VictoriaMetrics](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/).

VictoriaLogs provides some key advantages over other solutions:

- **Resource efficient**: Uses 30x less RAM and up to 15x less disk space than other solutions such as Elasticsearch and Grafana Loki. See [benchmarks](#benchmarks) and [How do open source solutions for logs work?](https://itnext.io/how-do-open-source-solutions-for-logs-work-elasticsearch-loki-and-victorialogs-9f7097ecbc2f) for details.
- **High scalability**: Performance and available resources (CPU, RAM, disk I/O, disk space) scale linearly. It can also scale horizontally to many nodes in [cluster mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/cluster/). It runs smoothly on Raspberry Pi and on servers with hundreds of CPU cores and terabytes of RAM.
- **Broad compatibility**: Ingests logs from widely used collectors like Promtail, Fluentd, Fluent Bit, Vector, Logstash, OpenTelemetry Collector, etc. See [Data Ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/).
- **Zero-config simplicity**: Very simple to install and use â€” no complex configuration needed. Much easier than Elasticsearch or Grafana Loki. See [Quick Start](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/quickstart/).
- **Powerful query language**: Provides its own [LogsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/) query language, with full-text search and support for all [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model).
- **Web UI**: Offers a [built-in web UI](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#web-ui) for log exploration and troubleshooting.
- **Grafana integration**: Provides a [Grafana plugin](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/victorialogs-datasource/) for building arbitrary dashboards in Grafana.
- **Command-line tool**: Includes [vlogscli](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/vlogscli/), an interactive CLI for querying VictoriaLogs. It also works well with classic Unix tools like `grep`, `less`, `sort`, `jq`, etc. See [CLI docs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#command-line) for details.
- **High-cardinality fields**: Supports [log fields](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#data-model) with many unique values (high cardinality) such as `trace_id`, `user_id`, and `ip`.
- **Multitenancy**: Supports [multiple tenants](#multitenancy) with isolated data streams.
- **Backfilling**: Accepts and stores log data with timestamps from the past or future (only 2 days ahead by default), regardless of the order in which they are received.
- **Live tailing**: Allows viewing logs in real-time as they are ingested. See [Live Tailing](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#live-tailing).
- **Contextual log selection**: Enables fetching logs before and after a specific log line. See [stream_context Pipe](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/logsql/#stream_context-pipe).
- **Alerting**: Can trigger alerts based on log queries. See [Alerting](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/vmalert/).
- **Wide events support**: Optimized for logs with hundreds of fields ([wide events](https://jeremymorrell.dev/blog/a-practitioners-guide-to-wide-events/)).

## Tuning

VictoriaLogs already uses reasonable settings by default for command-line flags, which are automatically adjusted and scaled with the available CPU and RAM resources.

It also uses reasonable settings for the OS. The only option is increasing the limit on [the number of open files in the OS](https://medium.com/@muhammadtriwibowo/set-permanently-ulimit-n-open-files-in-ubuntu-4d61064429a).

We recommend the following:

- Use `ext4` as the filesystem. The recommended persistent storage is [persistent HDD-based disk on GCP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/#pdspecs), since it is protected from hardware failures via internal replication and it can be [resized on the fly](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#resize_pd).
- If you plan to store more than 1TB of data on `ext4` partition or plan extending it to more than 16TB, then the following options are recommended to pass to `mkfs.ext4`:
  ```sh
  mkfs.ext4 ... -O 64bit,huge_file,extent -T huge
  ```

## Monitoring

VictoriaLogs integrates well with observability tools:

- **Metrics**: Exposes internal metrics in Prometheus exposition format at `http://localhost:9428/metrics`. It is recommended to monitor these metrics using [VictoriaMetrics](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#how-to-scrape-prometheus-exporters-such-as-node-exporter), [vmagent](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmagent/#how-to-collect-metrics-in-prometheus-format), or Prometheus.
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Official Grafana dashboards are available for [VictoriaLogs single-node](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/22084) and [VictoriaLogs cluster](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/23274) setups, maintained by the VictoriaMetrics team.
- **Alerts**: Set up [alerts](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/deployment/docker/rules/alerts-vlogs.yml) using [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/) or Prometheus.
- **Logs**: VictoriaLogs writes its own logs to stdout.

## Upgrading

It is generally safe to upgrade, downgrade, or skip versions. However, always review the [release notes](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/changelog/) for any breaking changes or important updates before proceeding.

We suggest enabling notifications for new releases. This helps you stay informed about changelogs and benefit from performance improvements, bug fixes, and new features.

Follow these steps when upgrading/downgrading:

- Send a `SIGINT` signal to the VictoriaLogs process to shut it down gracefully. See [how to send signals to processes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33239959/send-signal-to-process-from-command-line) for guidance.
- Wait for the process to stop. This may take a few seconds.
- Start the new version of VictoriaLogs.

## Retention

By default, VictoriaLogs stores log entries with timestamps from the past 7 days. Logs outside this range are dropped. You can change the retention period using the `-retentionPeriod` command-line flag. This flag accepts values from `1d` (1 day) up to `100y` (100 years). See the [Time Durations](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-durations) guide for supported formats.

For example, to set the retention period to 8 weeks:

```sh
/path/to/victoria-logs -retentionPeriod=8w
```

See also [Retention by disk space usage](#retention-by-disk-space-usage).

VictoriaLogs automatically drops logs with timestamps outside the configured retention period. This includes logs stored on disk and logs recently received.

If logs are being dropped during ingestion, there are several ways to troubleshoot:

- A sample of dropped logs is logged with a `WARN` message to assist with debugging.
- The `vl_rows_dropped_total` [metric](#monitoring) is increased each time a log is dropped due to an invalid timestamp.
- It is recommended to set up an alerting rule with [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmalert/) to be notified when logs with incorrect timestamps are ingested:

```yaml
- alert: RowsRejectedOnIngestion
  expr: rate(vl_rows_dropped_total[5m]) > 0
```

By default, VictoriaLogs does not accept log entries with timestamps more than 2 days in the future (`now+2d`). You can customize this limit using the `-futureRetention` flag. The minimum allowed value is `1d`.

## Retention by Disk Space Usage

VictoriaLogs stores log data in per-day partitions (see [Storage](#storage)).

To automatically remove old per-day partitions based on disk space usage, use the `-retention.maxDiskSpaceUsageBytes` flag. When the total size of data in the [`-storageDataPath` directory](#storage) exceeds this limit, VictoriaLogs deletes the oldest partitions to free up space.

For example, to set a storage limit of 100 GiB:

```sh
/path/to/victoria-logs -retention.maxDiskSpaceUsageBytes=100GiB
```

VictoriaLogs typically compresses logs by 10 times or more. This means it can store over a terabyte of raw log data with a 100 GiB disk limit.

There is one exception. VictoriaLogs always keeps at least the last two days of data to ensure queries for recent logs work correctly. If the last two days of data are larger than the limit, the total disk usage may go over `-retention.maxDiskSpaceUsageBytes`.

Note that the time-based retention (`-retentionPeriod`) and disk-based retention (`-retention.maxDiskSpaceUsageBytes`) work independently.

For example:

```sh
/path/to/victoria-logs -retentionPeriod=2d -retention.maxDiskSpaceUsageBytes=100GiB 
```

In this case, VictoriaLogs keeps at least the last two days of data and removes older partitions if total storage usage goes over 100 GiB.

## Storage

By default, VictoriaLogs stores all data in a directory named `/victoria-logs-data`. You can change this location using the `-storageDataPath` flag:

```sh
/path/to/victoria-logs -storageDataPath=/var/lib/victoria-logs
```

This `-storageDataPath` directory is created automatically on the first run if it does not exist.

Logs are stored in **daily subdirectories** inside the `<-storageDataPath>/partitions` directory. Each subdirectory is named using the `YYYYMMDD` format. For example, the `<-storageDataPath>/partitions/20250418` directory contains logs with `_time` field values from April 18, 2025 (UTC). See the [Time Field](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#time-field) documentation for more details.

## Forced merge

VictoriaLogs performs data compactions in background in order to keep good
performance characteristics when accepting new data. These compactions (merges)
are performed independently on per-day partitions. This means that compactions
are stopped for per-day partitions if no new data is ingested into these
partitions. Sometimes it is necessary to trigger compactions for old partitions.
In this case forced compaction may be initiated on the specified per-day
partition by sending request to
`/internal/force_merge?partition_prefix=YYYYMMDD`, where `YYYYMMDD` is per-day
partition name. For example,
`http://victoria-logs:9428/internal/force_merge?partition_prefix=20240921` would
initiate forced merge for September 21, 2024 partition. The call to
`/internal/force_merge` returns immediately, while the corresponding forced
merge continues running in background.

Forced merges may require additional CPU, disk IO and storage space resources.
It is unnecessary to run forced merge under normal conditions, since
VictoriaLogs automatically performs optimal merges in background when new data
is ingested into it.

## Forced flush

VictoriaLogs puts the recently
[ingested logs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/)
into in-memory buffers, which aren't available for
[querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/) for up to a
second. If you need querying logs immediately after their ingestion, then the
`/internal/force_flush` HTTP endpoint must be requested before querying. This
endpoint converts in-memory buffers with the recently ingested logs into
searchable data blocks.

It isn't recommended requesting the `/internal/force_flush` HTTP endpoint on a
regular basis, since this increases CPU usage and slows down data ingestion. It
is expected that the `/internal/force_flush` is requested in automated tests,
which need querying the recently ingested data.

## High Availability

### High Availability (HA) Setup with VictoriaLogs Single-Node Instances

This schema outlines how to configure a High Availability (HA) setup using
VictoriaLogs Single-Node instances. The setup consists of the following
components:

- **Log Collector**: The log collector should support multiplexing incoming data
  to multiple outputs (destinations). Popular log collectors like
  [Fluent Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/concepts/data-pipeline/router),
  [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/output-plugins.html),
  [Fluentd](https://docs.fluentd.org/output/copy), and
  [Vector](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/) already offer
  this capability. Refer to their documentation for configuration details.

- **VictoriaLogs Single-Node Instances**: Use two or more instances to achieve
  HA.

- **[vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/#load-balancing)
  or Load Balancer**: Used for reading data from one of the replicas to ensure
  balanced and redundant access.

![VictoriaLogs Single-Node Instance High-Availability schema](ha-victorialogs-single-node.webp)

Here are the working example of HA configuration for VictoriaLogs using Docker
Compose:

- [Fluent Bit + VictoriaLogs Single-Node + vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker/victorialogs/fluentbit/jsonline-ha)
- [Logstash + VictoriaLogs Single-Node + vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker/victorialogs/logstash/jsonline-ha)
- [Vector + VictoriaLogs Single-Node + vmauth](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/docker/victorialogs/vector/jsonline-ha)

## Backup and restore

VictoriaLogs currently does not have a snapshot feature and a tool like vmbackup
as VictoriaMetrics does. So backing up VictoriaLogs requires manually executing
the `rsync` command.

The files in VictoriaLogs have the following properties:

- All the data files are immutable. Small metadata files can be modified.
- Old data files are periodically merged into new data files.

Therefore, for a complete data **backup**, you need to run the `rsync` command
**twice**.

```sh
# example of rsync to remote host
rsync -avh --progress --delete <path-to-victorialogs-data> <username>@<host>:<path-to-victorialogs-backup>
```

The first `rsync` will sync the majority of the data, which can be
time-consuming. As VictoriaLogs continues to run, new data is ingested,
potentially creating new data files and modifying metadata files.

```sh
# example output
sending incremental file list
victoria-logs-data/
victoria-logs-data/flock.lock
              0 100%    0.00kB/s    0:00:00 (xfr#1, to-chk=78/80)

...

victoria-logs-data/partitions/20240809/indexdb/17E9ED7EF89BF422/metaindex.bin
             51 100%    5.53kB/s    0:00:00 (xfr#64, to-chk=0/80)

sent 12.19K bytes  received 1.30K bytes  3.86K bytes/sec
total size is 7.31K  speedup is 0.54
```

The second `rsync` **requires a brief shutdown of VictoriaLogs** to ensure all
data and metadata files are consistent and no longer changing. This `rsync` will
cover any changes that have occurred since the last `rsync` and should not take
a significant amount of time.

To **restore** from a backup, simply `rsync` the backup files from a remote
location to the original directory during downtime. VictoriaLogs will
automatically load this data upon startup.

```sh
# example of rsync from remote backup to local
rsync -avh --progress --delete <username>@<host>:<path-to-victorialogs-backup> <path-to-victorialogs-data>
```

It is also possible to use **the disk snapshot** in order to perform a backup.
This feature could be provided by your operating system, cloud provider, or
third-party tools. Note that the snapshot must be **consistent** to ensure
reliable backup.

## Multitenancy

VictoriaLogs supports multitenancy. A tenant is identified by
`(AccountID, ProjectID)` pair, where `AccountID` and `ProjectID` are arbitrary
32-bit unsigned integers. The `AccountID` and `ProjectID` fields can be set
during
[data ingestion](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/)
and [querying](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/) via
`AccountID` and `ProjectID` request headers.

If `AccountID` and/or `ProjectID` request headers aren't set, then the default
`0` value is used.

VictoriaLogs has very low overhead for per-tenant management, so it is OK to
have thousands of tenants in a single VictoriaLogs instance.

VictoriaLogs doesn't perform per-tenant authorization. Use
[vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) or similar
tools for per-tenant authorization.

### Multitenancy access control

Enforce access control for tenants by using
[vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/). Access
control can be configured for each tenant by setting up the following rules:

```yaml
users:
  - username: "foo"
    password: "bar"
    url_map:
      - src_paths:
          - "/select/.*"
          - "/insert/.*"
        headers:
          - "AccountID: 1"
          - "ProjectID: 0"
        url_prefix:
          - "http://localhost:9428/"

  - username: "baz"
    password: "bar"
    url_map:
      - src_paths: ["/select/.*"]
        headers:
          - "AccountID: 2"
          - "ProjectID: 0"
        url_prefix:
          - "http://localhost:9428/"
```

This configuration allows `foo` to use the `/select/.*` and `/insert/.*`
endpoints with `AccountID: 1` and `ProjectID: 0`, while `baz` can only use the
`/select/.*` endpoint with `AccountID: 2` and `ProjectID: 0`.

## Security

It is expected that VictoriaLogs runs in a protected environment, which is
unreachable from the Internet without proper authorization. It is recommended
providing access to VictoriaLogs
[data ingestion APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/)
and
[querying APIs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/querying/#http-api)
via [vmauth](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/vmauth/) or
similar authorization proxies.

## Benchmarks

  The benchmark can be reproduced by running `benchmark.sh` file inside
  `victorialogs` directory of the
  [ClickBench repository](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickBench/).

Here is a
[benchmark suite](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/tree/master/deployment/logs-benchmark)
for comparing data ingestion performance and resource usage between VictoriaLogs
and Elasticsearch or Loki.

It is recommended
[setting up VictoriaLogs](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/quickstart/)
in production alongside the existing log management systems and comparing
resource usage + query performance between VictoriaLogs and your system such as
Elasticsearch or Grafana Loki.

Please share benchmark results and ideas on how to improve benchmarks /
VictoriaLogs via
[VictoriaMetrics community channels](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victoriametrics/single-server-victoriametrics/#community-and-contributions).

## Profiling

VictoriaLogs provides handlers for collecting the following
[Go profiles](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs):

- Memory profile. It can be collected with the following command (replace
  `0.0.0.0` with hostname if needed):

```sh
curl http://0.0.0.0:9428/debug/pprof/heap > mem.pprof
```

- CPU profile. It can be collected with the following command (replace `0.0.0.0`
  with hostname if needed):

```sh
curl http://0.0.0.0:9428/debug/pprof/profile > cpu.pprof
```

The command for collecting CPU profile waits for 30 seconds before returning.

The collected profiles may be analyzed with
[go tool pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof). It is safe sharing the
collected profiles from security point of view, since they do not contain
sensitive information.

## List of command-line flags

Pass `-help` to VictoriaLogs in order to see the list of supported command-line
flags with their description:

```
  -blockcache.missesBeforeCaching int
    	The number of cache misses before putting the block into cache. Higher values may reduce indexdb/dataBlocks cache size at the cost of higher CPU and disk read usage (default 2)

    	Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
    	Value can contain comma inside single-quoted or double-quoted string, {}, [] and () braces.
  -datadog.maxRequestSize size
    	The maximum size in bytes of a single DataDog request
    	Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, TB, KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB (default 67108864)
  -datadog.streamFields array
    	Comma-separated list of fields to use as log stream fields for logs ingested via DataDog protocol. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/data-ingestion/datadog-agent/#stream-fields
    	Supports an array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
    	Value can contain comma inside single-quoted or double-quoted string, {}, [] and () braces.
  -defaultMsgValue string
    	Default value for _msg field if the ingested log entry doesn't contain it; see https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field (default "missing _msg field; see https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/keyconcepts/#message-field")
  -elasticsearch.version string
    	Elasticsearch version to report to client (default "8.9.0")
  -enableTCP6
    	Whether to enable IPv6 for listening and dialing. By default, only IPv4 TCP and UDP are used
  -envflag.enable

  -envflag.prefix string
    	Prefix for environment variables if -envflag.enable is set
  -filestream.disableFadvise
    	Whether to disable fadvise() syscall when reading large data files. The fadvise() syscall prevents from eviction of recently accessed data from OS page cache during background merges and backups. In some rare cases it is better to disable the syscall if it uses too much CPU
  -flagsAuthKey value
    	Auth key for /flags endpoint. It must be passed via authKey query arg. It overrides -httpAuth.*
    	Flag value can be read from the given file when using -flagsAuthKey=file:///abs/path/to/file or -flagsAuthKey=file://./relative/path/to/file . Flag value can be read from the given http/https url when using -flagsAuthKey=http://host/path or -flagsAuthKey=https://host/path
  -forceFlushAuthKey value
    	authKey, which must be passed in query string to /internal/force_flush . It overrides -httpAuth.* . See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#forced-flush
    	Flag value can be read from the given file when using -forceFlushAuthKey=file:///abs/path/to/file or -forceFlushAuthKey=file://./relative/path/to/file . Flag value can be read from the given http/https url when using -forceFlushAuthKey=http://host/path or -forceFlushAuthKey=https://host/path

    	Flag value can be read from the given file when using -forceMergeAuthKey=file:///abs/path/to/file or -forceMergeAuthKey=file://./relative/path/to/file . Flag value can be read from the given http/https url when using -forceMergeAuthKey=http://host/path or -forceMergeAuthKey=https://host/path
  -fs.disableMmap
    	Whether to use pread() instead of mmap() for reading data files. By default, mmap() is used for 64-bit arches and pread() is used for 32-bit arches, since they cannot read data files bigger than 2^32 bytes in memory. mmap() is usually faster for reading small data chunks than pread()
  -futureRetention value
    	Log entries with timestamps bigger than now+futureRetention are rejected during data ingestion; see https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#retention
    	The following optional suffixes are supported: s (second), h (hour), d (day), w (week), y (year). If suffix isn't set, then the duration is counted in months (default 2d)

    	Timeout for incoming idle http connections (default 1m0s)
  -http.maxGracefulShutdownDuration duration
    	The maximum duration for a graceful shutdown of the HTTP server. A highly loaded server may require increased value for a graceful shutdown (default 7s)
  -http.pathPrefix string
    	An optional prefix to add to all the paths handled by http server. For example, if '-http.pathPrefix=/foo/bar' is set, then all the http requests will be handled on '/foo/bar/*' paths. This may be useful for proxied requests. See https://www.robustperception.io/using-external-urls-and-proxies-with-prometheus
  -http.shutdownDelay duration
    	Optional delay before http server shutdown. During this delay, the server returns non-OK responses from /health page, so load balancers can route new requests to other servers
  -httpAuth.password value
    	Password for HTTP server's Basic Auth. The authentication is disabled if -httpAuth.username is empty
    	Flag value can be read from the given file when using -httpAuth.password=file:///abs/path/to/file or -httpAuth.password=file://./relative/path/to/file . Flag value can be read from the given http/https url when using -httpAuth.password=http://host/path or -httpAuth.password=https://host/path

    	Whether to use proxy protocol for connections accepted at the given -httpListenAddr . See https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt . With enabled proxy protocol http server cannot serve regular /metrics endpoint. Use -pushmetrics.url for metrics pushing
    	Supports array of values separated by comma or specified via multiple flags.
    	Empty values are set to false.
  -inmemoryDataFlushInterval duration
    	The interval for guaranteed saving of in-memory data to disk. The saved data survives unclean shutdowns such as OOM crash, hardware reset, SIGKILL, etc. Bigger intervals may help increase the lifetime of flash storage with limited write cycles (e.g. Raspberry PI). Smaller intervals increase disk IO load. Minimum supported value is 1s (default 5s)
  -insert.concurrency int
    	The average number of concurrent data ingestion requests, which can be sent to every -storageNode (default 2)
  -insert.disableCompression
